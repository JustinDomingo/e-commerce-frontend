# Fabrix eCommerce Website

This is a eCommerce website developed from scratch. An eCommerce website always seemed like one of the most challenging projects to complete, so that's where the inspiration for this website came from. The main purpose was to challenge and push myself to complete something that I have not done before. This project took a few months to complete.
